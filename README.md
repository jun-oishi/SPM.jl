## CITATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The algorithm for Villarrubia blind tip reconstruction is based on J. S. Villarrubia, “Algorithms for scanned probe microscope image simulation, surface reconstruction, and tip estimation,” _J. Res. Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol._, vol. 102, no. 4, p. 425, Jul. 1997, doi: 10.6028/jres.102.030.

The algorithm and codes for differentiable blind tip reconstruction is based on Y. Matsunaga, S. Fuchigami, T. Ogane, and S. Takada, “End-to-End Differentiable Blind Tip Reconstruction for Noisy Atomic Force Microscopy Images,” _Biophysics, preprint_, Sep. 2022. doi: 10.1101/2022.09.24.509314.

Codes for both reconstruction method are based on program written by Matsunaga et al. https://github.com/matsunagalab/differentiable_BTR and https://github.com/matsunagalab/MDToolbox.jl.
